## Code Review
I had a lot of fun writing this code. SVG's look daunting but after I understood it, it was easy. Transitions are tricky but handy. I liked the ">" line and I think it will open a lot of oppurtinities for future CSS. Not too many problems this time around, however I see that the hover is selection the whole image. I made the mistake of making it too small. So now the hover does exceed the actual SVG but that's because its counting the invisible space.
